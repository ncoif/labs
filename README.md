Various pieces of code and experiments

Yesterday I realized that I've lost a piece of code that might have been
usefull about node.js. So I've decided to use a source-control system even for
my personal experiement, so that it won't happen again.

I'm not particularly proud of this code, it's just a backup for myself.
